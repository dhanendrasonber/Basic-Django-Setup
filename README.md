# Project Setup Scripts Repository

Welcome to the Project Setup Scripts Repository! This repository provides shell (`.sh`) and PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts for setting up basic projects for various technologies. Our aim is to simplify the initial setup process for developers by providing ready-to-use scripts.

## Supported Technologies

- Django REST Framework
- more technologies coming soon

## Usage

### Shell Scripts (Linux and macOS)

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-setup-scripts.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd project-setup-scripts
    ```
3. Make the script executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x file_name.sh
    ```
4. Run the script for the desired technology:
    ```sh
    ./file_name.sh <projectName>
    ```
    If you don't provide a project name as an argument, the script will prompt you to enter it.

3. Run the script for the desired technology:
    ```ps1
    .\setup_django_project.ps1 -projectName <projectName>
